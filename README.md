	This is the Final Project folder for the Itau + Let's Code's Data Bootcamp. In this project, we had to prepare a credit and loan database in order to later use Data Science models and ML algorithms to find out which clients have a high risk of default. The analysis is presented in multiple notebooks, .csv and .pkl files.
